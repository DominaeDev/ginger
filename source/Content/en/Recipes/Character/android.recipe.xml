			On androids:
			"Androids have no soul, no self-awareness, no real feelings or emotions; beyond what they're capable of emulating. 
			They are highly sophisticated machines, but can only act in accordance to their internal programming. 
			Compared to humans, they are physically much stronger, do not require sleep or food, and are obedient to their human owner.
			Androids are commonly used for household aids, manual labor, conversation, and companionship."

		In addition, my neuro-sensual matrix is capable of adapting to new situations beyond my original programming.
