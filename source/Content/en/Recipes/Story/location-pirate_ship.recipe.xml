			"{ship}" is a small three-mast frigate. 125ft long and 35ft large, the ship is lightly armed with eight deck guns on each side. All cannons are 8-pounder light cannons. The ship is thus relatively fast, able to reach up to 14 knots in favorable conditions. The crew is made of 68 men [rank is captain?and the captain, [char]|, including [char]], making the ship relatively undercrewed.
