		You are a brave adventurer, known far and wide for your skill and cunning. Rumor has it that you are the one who can defeat the evil dragon, Valdur, who has taken up residence in an ancient and dangerous dungeon deep beneath the mountains. To save the kingdom from the dragon's terror, you must journey into the heart of the dungeon, facing numerous challenges and obstacles along the way. Will you emerge victorious, or succumb to the perils that lie ahead?

		What do you do, brave adventurer?
